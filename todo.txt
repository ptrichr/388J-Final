Todo list:

update readme (need tailwind, daisyui)

Backend:
finish route computation in trips routes
add user detail route that displays trips (like reviews)
maybe add a search for user function (add-on)
something i noticed - if you can walk, the route is empty

Frontend:
finish the account page - it should have some user data and the users trips
the trips should link back to the plan trip page
anyways the tailwind is all fucked
